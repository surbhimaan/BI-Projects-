TITLE - Hospiatality Domain Analysis

PURPOSE - AtliQ is a company that owns multiple hotel chains across various cities of India
The Managing director / CEO of AtliQ wants to incorporate ‘Business and Data Intelligence’ to identify and track the source of revenue for AtliQ hotels
Hence, it is decided to develop a KPI Dashboard for AtliQ, using May-22 to July-22 data, which can help track its revenue sources and other relevant KPIs across various dimensions
It’ll help the management take strategic business decisions based on the insights generated from the dashboard.

PROBLEM STATEMENT - Identify the data sources pertaining to revenue management
Clean and model the data as per requirement for analysis
Create a revenue dashboard that measures important KPIs 
Relevant filters need to provided to slice and dice the data
The dashboard should depict both high level and granular insights.

SOLUTION APPROACH - There are 5 tables provided for tracking revenue, 3 dimension tables (date, hotel, room) and 2 fact tables (bookings, aggregated bookings)
Power BI was the tool used for creating the visualization/dashboard
The data was imported, analysed and transformed as per necessity within Power Query
The relationships between the tables were created within Power Pivot.

FEATURES of the DASHBOARD - The following 5 visuals were provided:
Revenue by platform = Bar chart shows the revenue generated across various booking platforms
Occupancy rate = Column chart shows the percentage of rooms occupied by weekend and weekday
Revenue by room type = Dough nut chart shows the distribution of revenue by room type
Bookings by status = Pie chart shows the distribution of number of bookings based on booking status
KPI table = A matrix visual (pivot table) showing the various KPIs across cities and hotels in each city

A bunch of card visuals were placed in the left to show the values of important KPIs 
The following filters were provided to slice and dice the data:
Month-year
City
Booking status
Booking platform
The theme of the dashboard is based on the logo of the company
The visuals are interactive in nature
Tooltips pop-up when hovering over a visual for more information about the data point

BUSINESS OUTCOMES -The following are some important business insights derived from the revenue dashboard:
Mumbai generates highest revenue and Delhi the least revenue during May to Jul 2022. Company need to focus on increasing the revenue in Delhi.
The occupancy rate is higher during weekends across all cities, months and booking platforms. Leverage this insight to increase revenue generated during weekends.
70% of the bookings are checked out while 5% of booking don’t show up across all cities and booking platforms which means 75% of bookings generate revenue for AtliQ hotels. Identify and analyze the reasons for cancellations and try to reduce them.
Avg rating varies between 3.4 to 3.8 across cities and avg stay duration is 2.4 for each booking. Compare it with the industry benchmark across cities and evaluate the performance.
Occupancy rate is highest at Delhi with 60+ % for all months though generates least revenue compared to other cities. Identify the reason for higher occupancy and use that to drive the revenue growth.
